<p>Kenya bowed out of 2025 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifiers after settling for a barren draw against fellow underachievers Namibia on Tuesday afternoon at his afternoon at the Peter Mokaba Stadium in Polokwane Limpopo province in South Africa.</p>

<p>Both teams had bid bye to their qualification hopes with nothing left to fight for except pride, and both siders were keen to end their campaign on a winning note as they aim to build momentum from the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers that will return in March next year.
After a dull first half for both sides, Kenya’s best chance in the half came from substitute Daniel Sakari whose headedd effort from wingback Erick ‘Marcelo’ Ouma’s was kept off by a stifling Namibia rearguard for a corner.
The outcome means Firat’s charges wrap up their campaign in third place in Group J after collecting a meager six points from a probable 18, while their visitors Namibia finished last with two points. </p>
