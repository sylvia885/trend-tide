The Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) has condemned the demolition of residential apartments in Nairobi's Woodley Estate on Monday night,<br> describing it as a "colonial approach that should not happen in Kenya today".</p><p>

In a statement, Acting ODM Party Leader and Kisumu Governor Prof.<br> Anyang' Nyong'o expressed deep concern over the execution of the demolitions, stating that while the plan to use the Woodley Estate space for constructing high-density apartments is welcome, the way the demolitions were carried out in the dead of night was both inhumane and appalling.</p><p>

"The better procedure would have been to develop a high-density housing unit elsewhere and facilitate the transfer of Woodley residents there in a humane and well-organized manner.<br> To go out at night and bring down the houses is a colonial approach that should not happen in Kenya today," said Nyong'o.<br>"The ODM party wishes to condemn the demolitions and appeal to the Nairobi County Government not to be Pharisees in the execution of the law but to be humane in serving Kenyans."<p>

He added that the demolitions violated the Constitution, particularly Article 43(1)(b), which guarantees the right to adequate housing. He also pointed out that the demolitions contravened the United Nations guidelines on involuntary resettlement.

"It should be noted that Woodley Estate has been home to many Kenyans one of whom is the Kapenguria 6 freedom fighter Ramogi Achieng’ Oneko"</p>

<p>Further Nyong'o stated that Woodley Estate has been home to many prominent Kenyans, including the late Kapenguria Six freedom fighter Ramogi Achieng’ Oneko, former US President Barack Obama's father, Barack Obama Sr., and other key historical figures

"Others who have been living at Woodley were Argwings Kodhek, Jaramogi Oginga Odinga’s speechwriter Odinge Odera, former State House official and well-known broadcaster Sammy Lui and Ukambani politician, the late Mulu Mutisya, among many other professionals and history makers." 
<br>A total of 43 residents, including veteran broadcaster Sammy Lui, lost their homes during the demolitions. The residents opposed the move, arguing that they were not involved in the decision-making process before the demolitions were carried out.</p>	<br>
